# Weak Reset Password Implementation

The bug name which I found was “Password Reset Link Not Expired After Use”. This comes under the VRT of “Insufficient Security Configurability >Weak Reset Password Implementation > Token Not Invalidated After Use”

Steps To Find This Bug:

    Go to https://target.com/ password reset page.
    Enter your email, and ask for a password reset link.
    Now go to mail and open that link in two tabs.
    Reset the password from one tab, reload the other tab , and if it let’s you reset password again then it is vulnerable to token not invalidated after use as we are resetting the password two times with same token.

Impact/Exploit Scenario: If victim’s email account is still logged into his/her Office Computers or any public Internet Café. Then any external attacker can use the used token to reset victims password.

Severity: Now due to this difficult to happen exploit scenario , which requires user interaction it is given as a P4 bug under Bugcrowd VRT.

Now this feature can be also used to sometimes chain it with other vulnerabilities, to get higher severity depending on the functionalities present in the website.




# SXSS

So in one of the subdomain of the program I received, had a feature of styling a page of app by adding different features and styles.
Feature Page

In there in each and every section like “ Name” , “A little about yourself” etc I injected XSS Payload “><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
Injected Payload

Now as I clicked on “Add Content” I got XSS Pop Up.
Payload Executed

But here as you can see, it has no get parameters or anything or not even share feature, which I could use to send this to other user, otherwise this is right now Self Stored XSS, which is a P5/no-impact vulnerability☹️.

So I started looking for ways with which I can increase the impact, or any methods I can send this page to other users, then the QR Code on the top right corner just caught my eye🧐, so I thought of testing it.

As soon as I scanned this QR Code it opened up a site, In which my XSS payload executed😍, so finally I have converted Self XSS to Non-Self XSS hance now P2 severity😈.
Non Self Executed XSS
