that's my bugbounty/ hacking rep - if you like it and want to contrib, welcome ;^)
it mainly focuses on cloud hacking (starting with aws > gcp > azure ...), 
web hacking (with focus on miscofnigs and exposure like the "PHP Web Frameworks" file, 
and some API stuff

it's going to be updated much more frequently post Nov 2024
that's it. happy hacking!
