that's my bugbounty/ hacking rep - if you like it and want to contrib, welcome ;^)
it mainly focuses on cloud hacking (starting with aws > gcp > azure ...), 
web hacking (with focus on miscofnigs and exposure like the https://github.com/ex16x41/bugbounty/blob/main/WEB/WEB-FRAMEWORKS/WebFrameworks-Exposures.md file, 
and some API stuff

it's going to be updated much more frequently post Nov 2024
that's it. happy hacking!
