    New Endpoints: Look for any references to new API endpoints within the JavaScript code. These endpoints might provide additional functionalities or access to specific features that are not available through the web application’s user interface.
    New Parameters: Pay attention to any new parameters being utilized in the JavaScript code. These parameters may allow you to manipulate or customize the behavior of the application.
    Hidden Features: Sometimes, the JavaScript code may contain sections or functions that are not exposed in the web application’s interface. These hidden features could potentially provide additional functionality or access to premium-only features. Determine if you can interact with these features even without a premium account.
    API Keys: Look for any occurrences of API keys within the JavaScript code. These keys may grant access to restricted APIs or sensitive data. Make sure to handle them securely and avoid exposing them.
    Developer Comments: Explore the JavaScript code for any developer comments, such as single-line (//) or multi-line (/* */) comments. These comments may reveal valuable information about the code, such as the date of publication or updates.
