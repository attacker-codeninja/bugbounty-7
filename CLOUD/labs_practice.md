## flaws 

http://flaws.cloud/  -aws (tested, nice)

## pwndlabs

## hacktricks

https://training.hacktricks.xyz/ - best of them all in the market imho - like the OSCP of cloud - training for AWS + GCP + AZURE (coming soon)

## hack the box 

https://www.hackthebox.com/business/professional-labs/cloud-labs-blacksky - have not tested yet 

## others 

https://cyberwarfare.live/product/aws-cloud-red-team-specialist-carts/  - did not test 

https://cybr.com/announcements/introducing-free-aws-cloud-security-hands-on-labs/ - tested, not quite sure how i feel about this one, maybe the way the material is explained doesn't fit me personally

## best kind of practice imho - open your own aws acc > test everything from within
