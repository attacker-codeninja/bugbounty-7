## here I will include all possible exploitation IRL cases - what i hacked (in lab) scenarios, which commands used, which tricks included, comments
## this is only for myself for my learning journey to have an organized understanding of hacking scenarios (where and how commands can be used, chain of commands etc)
## based on already public knowledge (commands, resources of aws) but my own practice
## exploitation and hacking of aws as far as I see it now, is really abuse permissions abuse at most

|aws --profile >PROFILENAME> sts get-caller-identity| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63860e9e-35a7-4409-b3f7-8446ae91f0e9) | in this scenario we see that our user has permissions in the policy attached to us, to create policy version and set defaut policy version - we abuse exactly that to add admin priv and set as new policy |
